Hello GitHub! We are **Cana|Data NetSec** and we are happy to be part of the community.
We are a small team of Canadian IT Professionals based on the east coast in New Brunswick.
Our areas of interest include:

- **LAN**s - *technology, processes, security*
- **Wireless Radio Technology** - *WiFi, BT(LE), SDR*
- **Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing** - *software, hardware, etc...*

As a result of our interest in wireless radio technology, we actively "war-drive" or "stumble" via [WiGLE](https://www.wigle.net)
