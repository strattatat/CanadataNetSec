## Cana|Data - A Strattatabrand
---
### *Canadian based Information Technology.*
Hello GitHub! I'm Stratton <-- yep, that's really my name.  Some call me Stratt, Stratty or Strattatat.
I'm an easy going key-clacker from NB, Canada and I have a professional background in enterprise Net Admin but
my true IT passion lies in cyber-security & penetration testing.  When I need to, I brand my work as **Cana|Data**.

My fortÃ©s in the realm:

- **LAN**s - *technology, processes, security hardening*
- **Wireless Radio Technology** - *WiFi, BT(LE), SDR*
- **OSINT Operations** - *techniques, software, tradecraft*

I am a proud WiGLE member where I contribute stats via "war-driving" or "stumbling" - [WiGLE](https://www.wigle.net)
